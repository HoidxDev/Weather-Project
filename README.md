# Weather-Project
Coded Weather Project with ReactJS, TailwindCSS and GSAP in 1 day. I have made something soft and simple. I've used OpenWeatherAPI, Custom Google API and Google Search Engine.
Simply, you can enter your city and see how is the weather like. In the mean time, one of your city picture displaying on right side.  I will improve this simple project later.
Please share your comments and reviews,  welcomed!
